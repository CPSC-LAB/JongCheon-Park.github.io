ã€€Research on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles has been actively conducted in recent years. In particular, the UAV to explore an unknown, GNSS-denied environment is required, but the self-localization method, such as Visual Inertial Odometry, is mandatory to operate it. Considering the payload and the operating time of the UAV, lightweight and low-power consuming cameras and IMU are preferred, and even Object Detection and 3D Mapping can be obtained using a RGB-D camera. In this work, we developed a 3D Mapping system including object positions in an unknown and GNSS-denied environment for the UAV with a RGB-D camera. The system is demonstrated in Gazebo simulator, and the quantitative and qualitative results are obtained.</p>
